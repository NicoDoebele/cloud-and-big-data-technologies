# Legacy Files and Previous Versions

## Overview

The `.old/` directory contains previous versions of the project that were replaced with more efficient automated solutions.

## What's in `.old/`

### Manual Deployment Configurations
- Individual Kubernetes YAML files for each MongoDB component
- Manual kubectl apply commands requiring specific ordering
- Manual replica set and sharding configuration
- No automated dependency resolution

### Non-Optimal Solutions
- **Before**: Manual, error-prone deployments taking hours
- **After**: Automated Helm charts with Terraform integration

## Why Keep It?

- **Reference**: Shows project evolution from manual to automated
- **Learning**: Demonstrates progression toward better practices
- **Backup**: Emergency fallback if needed
- **History**: Documents architectural decisions and improvements

## Key Improvements

- **Automation**: Manual steps → Fully automated deployment
- **Reliability**: Error-prone → Consistent, reproducible deployments
- **Scalability**: Difficult to modify → Easy to scale and configure
- **Production Ready**: Development configs → Production with proper limits

## Evolution

1. **Manual Kubernetes Manifests** - Individual YAML files, manual ordering
2. **Basic Helm** - Simple charts, limited automation
3. **Current** - Comprehensive Helm + Terraform automation

The current approach provides robust, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure that can handle production workloads reliably.
